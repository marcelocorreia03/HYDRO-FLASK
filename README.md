## Founders 

"Hydro Flask, maker of insulated steel bottles, was founded in 2009 by Travis Rosbach and Cindy Morse, then a couple frustrated by the lukewarm beverages their water bottles offered after a day at the beach. That relationship didn't last, but the Bend, Oregon-based company did. Current CEO Scott Allan joined in mid-2012 after an investor bought out the founders and revamped the board. Since 2011, the company has grown sales to $35.6 million from $2 million, and boosting jobs from 7 to 50 over the period. And in spite of a major supply chain disruption that could have ended it all, the company landed  at No. 313 on the 2015 Inc. 5000."
